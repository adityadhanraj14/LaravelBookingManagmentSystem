# Laravel Booking Management System

Welcome to the **Laravel Booking Management System**, my first full-stack project developed during my second semester of college. This project was a significant learning experience, introducing me to the MVC architecture and the Laravel framework.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application demonstrates a basic booking management system built with Laravel. It covers essential concepts such as:

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for bookings, users, and web pages
- Separation of concerns for models, views, and controllers

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

Due to certain PHP/XAMPP local settings, this project cannot be hosted live at the moment.  
However, you can refer to the attached video and database structure for a complete understanding of the system’s functionality.

## ✨ Personal Reflection

This was my first complete project, and although I followed tutorials to build it, the process taught me a lot about web development fundamentals. Working with Laravel helped me understand how to organize code using the MVC pattern and how to connect different components of a web application.

While the tech stack may be dated, this project holds a special place as my starting point in software development. In the future, I plan to refactor and upgrade this project using modern technologies like **React.js** and **MongoDB**.
